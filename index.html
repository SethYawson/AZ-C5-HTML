    <h1>Introduction </h1>

    <!-- First Paragraph-->
         <p> An <b>entrepreneurial ecosystem</b> is the set of activities, linkages, and interactions that support 
         entrepreneurs in a region, and help grow new companies, leading to a more diverse economy and
         economic growth. The density and completeness of the ecosystem are related to increased success
         among its <i>entrepreneurs</i>; missing pieces of the ecosystem can slow or derail entrepreneurial activities.
         This is particularly difficult in more rural regions where the lack of critical mass can make it even
         more challenging to start and grow companies than in regions with more resources.</p>
